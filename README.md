# Web3 Development Adventures: My Personal Journey of Learning

Welcome to my "ic-projects" repository! This is where I share my personal journey of exploration and development in Web3, blockchain, and decentralized technologies. 

The projects I've been engaged in span a diverse set of subjects, including:

- Building decentralized applications (DApps) across various platforms using Motoko & JS
- Delving into the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and deploying apps on its live blockchain network
- Designing custom cryptocurrency tokens and exploring their potential use cases
- Crafting NFT marketplaces and investigating the myriad applications of digital asset ownership
